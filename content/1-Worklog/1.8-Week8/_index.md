### Week 8 Achievements:

#### High-Performing Architectures

**Compute Scaling:**

* Distinguished vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling.  
* Understood Auto Scaling Groups, scaling policies, and the mechanism to increase/decrease EC2 capacity based on system load.

**Storage Optimization**

* Understood S3 tiering mechanisms (S3 Standard → IA → Glacier) to balance performance and cost.

**Caching**

* Caching reduces backend load and improves application performance.  
* Leveraged Amazon CloudFront and ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) to reduce latency.

**Network Optimization**

* Understood the importance of VPC Endpoints, enhanced networking, and data path optimization.  
* Used CloudFront to reduce global latency.

#### Cost-Optimized Architectures

**AWS Budget:** Configure alerts based on actual or forecasted spending.

**Saving Plans:**

* Compute Saving Plans are flexible (support EC2, Fargate, Lambda).  
* EC2 Instance Saving Plans offer deeper discounts but with less flexibility.

**Reserved Instances (RI):**

* Commit 1–3 years to reduce costs for EC2/RDS.  
* Suitable for stable and predictable workloads.
