### Week 9 Objectives:

* Become proficient in working with DynamoDB using AWS CLI and understand NoSQL table structures.  
* Generate test data using AI to validate the system.  
* Finalize the overall project architecture, select appropriate AWS services, and estimate deployment costs.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| 2 | \- Practice writing CLI commands to create DynamoDB tables \- Use AI to generate test data for the system | 03/11/2025 | 03/11/2025 | |
| 3 | \- Discuss and finalize AWS services for the project, redraw the architecture, estimate cost with Pricing Calculator, assign tasks and roles for team members | 04/11/2025 | 04/11/2025 | |
| 4 | \- Create mock data for the project, refine features to align with AWS Personalize requirements | 05/11/2025 | 07/11/2025 | |

### Week 9 Achievements:

#### Working with DynamoDB using AWS CLI

* Learned how to create DynamoDB tables with CLI, defining Partition Key and Sort Key.  
* Practiced using commands to add items (put-item), retrieve items (get-item), query data (query), and scan tables (scan).  
* Gained a clear understanding of JSON structure and how to map data in a NoSQL environment.

#### Difficulties Encountered

* DynamoDB CLI syntax is lengthy and JSON formatting is easy to get wrong.  
* Initial mock data lacked logical consistency, leading to poor results when training with Amazon Personalize.

#### Solutions & Lessons Learned

* Used JSON template files to avoid missing fields or incorrect formatting.  
* Adjusted mock data to follow realistic user behavior patterns.
