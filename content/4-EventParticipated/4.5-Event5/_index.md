# **Event Report: “Building Agentic AI – Context Optimization with Amazon Bedrock”**

**Event Date:** 05/12/2025  
**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Financial Tower

## **1. Event Objectives**

The event focused on how to build **Agentic AI** (multi-task, multi-agent AI systems) through:

* Context Optimization when designing AI agents.  
* Applying Amazon Bedrock for multi-agent workflows.  
* Enterprise automation solutions from Diaflow and CloudThinker.  
* Sharing practical experience in agent deployment, tool design, and workflow construction.

## **2. Speakers**

**Nguyen Gia Hung** — Head of Solutions Architect, AWS  
**Kien Nguyen** — Solutions Architect, AWS  
**Viet Pham** — Founder & CEO, Diaflow  
**Kha Van** — Community Leader, AWS  
**Thang Ton** — Co-Founder  
**Henry Bui** — Head of Engineering  

## **3. Key Content Highlights** 

### Session 1 – Agent Core (AWS)

* React Agent – executing tasks sequentially.  
* Designing Tools in an Agent System.  
* Optimizing evaluation and monitoring from day one (Eval & Observability).  
* Multi-agent & Multi-session: each task/department operates its own agent flow, coordinated via a supervisor agent.

### Session 2 – Diaflow

**Business Problems**

According to Diaflow’s presentation:

* **90% of businesses waste ~20 hours/week on repetitive tasks.**  
* The main concern: **AI may leak sensitive data** during processing.

**Diaflow’s Solution**

Diaflow addresses this with an AI model running entirely on the enterprise’s own infrastructure:

* **Enterprises retain full control over data flows** through MCP.  
* Supports integration with multiple Google and AWS services.  
* Internal automation applications:

  * Database Automation  
  * Document processing  
  * Knowledge base  
  * Building internal tools/apps  

**Benefits**

* **Process Efficiency:** Automates up to 80% of repetitive tasks.  
* **Cost-saving:** Can be deployed in minutes, replacing many disconnected tools.  
* **Usability:** Simple interface, enabling anyone to build automated workflows.

**Integration with AWS Bedrock**

* Combines **multiple models (multi-model)**.  
* Optimizes data security at an enterprise level.  
* Enables cost optimization at scale.

### Session 3 – CloudThinker

**Enterprise Cloud Challenges**

* Infrastructure costs can easily skyrocket (Cost Explosion).  
* Cloud systems are complex and hard to monitor.  
* It is difficult to react quickly when incidents occur.

**CloudThinker’s Solution**

A comprehensive “all-in-one” platform including:

* **Code Review Automation**  
* **Incident Response Agent**  
* **Operations & Optimization**  
* **Security & Compliance Automation**  

Built on a multi-agent framework, this solution helps:

* Automate operations  
* Reduce costs  
* Continuously optimize systems  
* Improve incident response capability  

**Context Optimization**

Highlighted as the key factor determining agent system performance:

* User input for a chatbot is only about ~10% of the input required for an agent system.  
* Context overload leads to degraded performance.

**Context optimization techniques:**

* Prompt Caching  
* Context Compaction  
* Tool Consolidation (grouping tools into MCI)  
* Parallel Tool Calling  
* Cross-Region Inference  

**Multi-agent Architecture**

* A **Supervisor Agent** orchestrates the system.  
* **Specialist Agents** handle specialized tasks.  
* Delegation architecture reduces latency and distributes workloads.

**Challenges & Implementation Experience**

* The hardest part is the **Agent Starter** – building the first agent and the tool-calling model.  
* Tools must be properly designed from the outset.  
* A robust **Eval & Observability** system is mandatory to avoid “AI out of control.”

## **4. Key Takeaways**

The knowledge from this workshop is highly applicable to ongoing AI/Cloud projects:

* Building **multi-agent systems** so AI chatbots can analyze, plan, and call complex APIs.  
* Applying **context optimization** to reduce costs and increase inference performance.  
* Using Diaflow for internal workflow automation, especially for data extraction and RAG.  
* Adopting CloudThinker’s mindset for monitoring, operations, and incident response in AI/ML systems.

## **5. Overall Evaluation**

* The event was professionally organized, with cutting-edge content aligned to real enterprise needs.  
* Practical examples from Diaflow and CloudThinker helped participants clearly visualize how to implement agents in real-world scenarios.  
* AWS’s sessions provided a solid technical foundation for agentic AI, emphasizing data flows and tool design.
