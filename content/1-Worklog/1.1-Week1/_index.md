### Week 1 Achievements:

#### Create AWS Account

* Understood the structure of an AWS account: root user, IAM users, billing, and security.  
* Root user should only be used for sensitive tasks (such as Billing setup, enabling MFA, financial support).  
* Recognized the importance of MFA based on AWS security principles (Least Privilege & Multi-Factor Authentication).

#### Create AWS Budget

* Learned how to configure a Cost Budget to monitor expenses and receive email alerts when exceeding thresholds.  
* Understood and distinguished the concepts of Actual cost (real incurred cost) vs Forecasted cost (projected end-of-month cost).

#### Learn IAM and create IAM Admin

* Understood IAM structure: User \- Group \- Role \- Policy.  
* Distinguished the concepts of IAM User (human/application) and IAM Role (permissions assumed temporarily by services or users).  
* Created an IAM Admin user to replace root for daily operations.

#### Learn AWS Support and submit Support Case

* Learned the 4 levels of Support: Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise.  
* Under Free Tier, only Basic Support is available, including:  
  * Documentation, forums, basic Trusted Advisor checks  
  * Ability to submit Support Cases related to billing  
* Learned how to create a ticket to get familiar with the technical support workflow.

### Difficulties Encountered

* Difficulty understanding the structure of IAM Policy JSON (Action, Resource, Effect).

### Solutions & Lessons Learned

* Reviewed sample policies in AWS Documentation and used the Visual Editor interface to simplify IAM Policy creation.
