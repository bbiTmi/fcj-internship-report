## 1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

### 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Customer Background:**
The DaiVietBlood system is designed to serve the community, including voluntary blood donors, patients in need of emergency blood, and healthcare professionals in Vietnam. The primary customers are blood donors, patient families, and medical staff responsible for managing blood inventory and donation schedules. They require a centralized, reliable platform to optimize the matching process between donors and recipients and improve communication during emergencies. In the context of digital health transformation, DaiVietBlood provides a secure, accessible solution to address localized blood shortages.

**Business and Technical Objectives:**
Migrating the DaiVietBlood system from a local/on-premise environment to AWS offers superior advantages:

- **Business:** AWS allows the application to scale flexibly according to the user base, reduces hardware infrastructure operational costs, and ensures consistent performance nationwide.
- **Technical:** AWS provides High Availability and medical data security. Adopting a **Serverless Architecture** (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, RDS) simplifies backend management, accelerates development, and reduces maintenance costs. The system integrates comprehensive monitoring (CloudWatch) and adheres to strict security standards.

### 1.2 PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA

1.  **Functionality:** 100% of core functions (registration, scheduling, emergency requests, administration) operate stably on AWS with no regression errors.
2.  **Availability:** System achieves Uptime ≥ 99.9%, ensuring continuous 24/7 access.
3.  **Performance:** Application response time improves by at least 30% compared to the local version. Emergency request processing time is reduced by 40%.
4.  **Cost:** Infrastructure costs are optimized by at least 20% thanks to the Serverless model and Auto-scaling.
5.  **User Experience:** UAT acceptance rate reaches a minimum of 95% for all user roles.
6.  **Security:** Full compliance with data encryption, access management (IAM), and API security requirements.
7.  **Operations:** CI/CD pipeline is fully automated with deployment time < 10 minutes. Monitoring system covers 100% of critical services.

### 1.3 ASSUMPTIONS

**Technical & Architectural Assumptions:**

- **Source Code:** The current Local application (Frontend & Backend) is functionally complete. The project focuses on Refactoring for the Cloud (Serverless), excluding the development of new features.
- **AWS Region:** The entire infrastructure is deployed in **Singapore (ap-southeast-1)** to optimize latency for users in Vietnam. _Note: During the testing phase, due to limited VPC configurations and Free Tier/Student resources, latency may fluctuate (estimated ~3.5s/request)._
- **Service Limits:** The AWS account uses default limits (Soft limits). Increasing limits to reduce latency will be approved by the Customer when necessary.
- **Third-party Integration:** The system uses the Gemini API for AI support features.
- **Access Rights:** The Skyline Team is granted Admin access (IAM Role) to provision resources.

**Operational & Financial Assumptions:**

- **Domain:** The Customer owns the domain name (e.g., daivietblood.com) and DNS configuration rights.
- **Cost:** The cost estimate is based on an assumption of approximately 50,000 API requests/month. Actual costs depend on usage levels (Pay-as-you-go).

## 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM

### 2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

The DaiVietBlood system utilizes a **Serverless-First** architecture on AWS Cloud, prioritizing scalability, security, and operational optimization.

![AWS architecture picture](/images/AWS_Architecture.png)

**Key Components:**

1.  **Network Infrastructure (VPC):**
    - _Public Subnet:_ Contains Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway.
    - _Private Subnet:_ Contains AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS to isolate and secure data, preventing direct Internet access.
2.  **Application & Data:**
    - _Frontend:_ Hosted on **AWS Amplify**, distributed via **Amazon CloudFront** (CDN), and assets stored on **S3**.
    - _Authentication:_ **Amazon Cognito** manages identity and issues JWT tokens.
    - _API & Compute:_ **Amazon API Gateway** receives requests and routes them to **AWS Lambda** for business logic processing.
    - _Database:_ **Amazon RDS** stores structured data, located in the Private Subnet.
3.  **DevOps & Monitoring:**
    - _CI/CD:_ Uses **AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy** to automate the deployment process.
    - _Monitoring:_ **Amazon CloudWatch** centrally collects logs and metrics.

### 2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN

The technical implementation process follows the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) methodology:

- **Infrastructure Automation:** Use **AWS CloudFormation** to provision VPC, Lambda, RDS, and API Gateway, ensuring consistency across environments (Dev/Staging/Prod).
- **Application Development:** Refactor backend into modular Lambda functions (NodeJS/Python). Environment variables and sensitive information (DB credentials) are securely encrypted.
- **CI/CD Process:**
  - Source (GitHub) -> Build (CodeBuild) -> Deploy (CloudFormation/CodeDeploy).
  - Includes a Manual Approval step before deploying to the Production environment.
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit Tests for Lambda, Integration Tests for API, and Load Tests to ensure capacity.

### 2.3 PROJECT PLAN

The project applies the Agile Scrum model over 8 weeks (4 Sprints):

- **Sprint 1 (Foundation):** Set up AWS Account, VPC, RDS.
- **Sprint 2 (Backend Core):** Develop Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito.
- **Sprint 3 (Integration):** Deploy Frontend (Amplify), finalize CI/CD Pipeline.
- **Sprint 4 (Stabilization):** UAT, Performance Optimization, Handover.

### 2.4 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1.  **Access Management:** Use Cognito for user authentication and IAM Roles for service authorization (Least Privilege).
2.  **Network Isolation:** Database and Lambda are located in the Private Subnet, accessing the Internet only via NAT Gateway.
3.  **Data Protection:** Data encryption At-rest (on RDS/S3) and In-transit (via HTTPS).
4.  **Security Monitoring:** CloudWatch Logs record all activities for auditing and intrusion detection.
